# Neural Network for Titanic Dataset

In this notebook, we apply Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to the Titanic dataset. The process involves several key steps to harness the power of neural networks for predicting survival outcomes:

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the Titanic dataset for effective model training.
2. **Normalization**: Standardizing the numerical features to ensure consistent scaling for the neural network.
3. **Model Architecture**: Defining the structure of the neural network, including the number of layers and nodes.
4. **Model Compilation**: Specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics for training.
5. **Model Training**: Utilizing the training dataset to optimize the neural network's parameters.
6. **Loss & Accuracy Visualization**: Examining the training process through visualizations of loss and accuracy metrics.

## Core Concepts Explored:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
- **Normalization**: Standardizing numerical features to improve the convergence of the neural network.
- **Sequential Model**: Building a neural network model layer by layer using the Keras Sequential API.
- **Dense Layers**: Employing densely connected layers for information propagation.
- **Activation Functions**: Integrating activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
- **Loss Function & Optimizer**: Selecting appropriate loss functions and optimizers for training the model.

## Evaluation Metrics:

- **Loss**: The measure of error during model training.
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances.

Through this notebook, we aim to leverage the capabilities of neural networks to predict survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset, offering insights into the application of deep learning in classification tasks.
